// The one place that knows how to delete downloaded chapters safely.
//
// Ordering matters and is easy to get wrong: the download queue's
// cancellation is cooperative, so a job that already started keeps
// running until its current fetch resolves. Deleting first and
// cancelling second (or not awaiting between them) lets the worker
// write content.json and flip downloadedAt back on after the user
// deleted — from their side, the delete silently did nothing.
//
// Every delete affordance in the UI goes through here rather than
// calling deleteChapterDownloads directly.

  //    only one of them is visible in the snapshot.
  //
  //    (a) Files on disk with the flag already clear — the state that
  //        actually occurs. A worker sitting inside writeChapterContent
  //        when our remove(dir) lands writes its images BEFORE
  //        content.json, so it recreates files inside the directory we
  //        just removed. Its next progress poll then throws
  //        CancelledError and markChapterDownloaded never runs: files
  //        on disk, flag clear. The row reads "not downloaded", so the
  //        user has no reason to delete it again and nothing will ever
  //        reclaim that space — in a feature whose entire purpose is
  //        reclaiming space. Nothing in the snapshot reveals this, so
  //        every id that was mid-flight is swept again unconditionally.
  //        That set is bounded by the queue's concurrency (<= 5), so it
  //        is at most five extra remove() calls.
  //
  //    (b) The flag itself flipped back on — a worker that got all the
  //        way through markChapterDownloaded during the sweep. This one
  //        MUST be read fresh from disk, not from `first.snapshot`:
  //        deleteChapterDownloads strips downloadedAt for every id it
  //        was just asked to delete before returning that same
  //        snapshot, so `first.snapshot` always shows the flag clear
  //        for all of `ids` and checking it could never find a
  //        resurrection. Checked across every id we deleted rather than
  //        only the mid-flight ones, so a late write we did not predict
  //        is still caught.
