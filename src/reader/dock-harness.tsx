// Dev-only rig for the DOCKED Contents panel.
//
// Mounts the real DesktopReader over a synthetic book so the docking layout
// can be seen and measured without a Tauri backend — the app's own library and
// import paths need `invoke`, and driving the installed desktop app would
// rewrite the real library.
//
// What it is here to show: Contents claims a real 340px strip beside the
// reading column rather than floating over it, the column keeps its place in
// the book across the reflow that causes, and the panel stays open while you
// move between chapters.
//
// Nothing here is imported by the app. Open it with `pnpm dev` at
// /dock-harness.html.
