  //
  // The OUTER layer is a fixed window at the edge, `overflow: hidden`, sized by
  // the bar inside it. It exists because a transformed box still counts toward
  // its container's scrollable overflow: sliding a bar to `translateY(±100%)`
  // directly in the reader root grew that root's scrollHeight past its
  // clientHeight, quietly making the whole reader scrollable. `overflow:
  // hidden` there only suppresses the scrollbar — the element stays
  // programmatically scrollable, and the Contents panel's `scrollIntoView`
  // (which walks up every scrollable ancestor) then dragged the entire page out
  // of position. Clipping the slide inside this window keeps the translate from
  // ever reaching the root's overflow region.
  //
  // `visibility` on the outer flips only after the fade finishes: it keeps the
  // exit smooth and takes a hidden bar's buttons out of the tab order instead
  // of leaving invisible focus stops behind.
  //
  // A floating bar stops short of a docked panel rather than lying across it.
  // Spanning the full width put the bar on top of the panel's own header, so
  // once it was out the close button sat underneath it — and because the bar
  // occupies the same band that summons it, hovering the covered button held
  // the bar there. The control was unreachable until you moved away and
  // waited. `insetInlineStart` is logical, so this lands on whichever edge the
  // strip is on and needs no separate RTL case.

  //   only ever a nicety: the clip window above is `overflow: hidden`, so the
