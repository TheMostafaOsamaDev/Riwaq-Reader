  // of position. Clipping the slide inside this window keeps the translate from
  // ever reaching the root's overflow region.
  //
  // `visibility` on the outer flips only after the fade finishes: it keeps the
  // exit smooth and takes a hidden bar's buttons out of the tab order instead
  // of leaving invisible focus stops behind.
  //
  // A floating bar stops short of a docked panel rather than lying across it.
  // Spanning the full width put the bar on top of the panel's own header, so
  // once it was out the close button sat underneath it — and because the bar
  // occupies the same band that summons it, hovering the covered button held
