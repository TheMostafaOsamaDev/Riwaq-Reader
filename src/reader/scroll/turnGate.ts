/**
 * Decides whether a wheel event at a chapter's edge should turn the chapter.
 *
 * This replaces a 200-line velocity engine, and the reason it can be this
 * small is the end-of-chapter card. That engine had to INFER intent from the
 * gesture — scaling a threshold with wheel speed, discarding momentum tails,
 * charging 1.6-4.6 notches — because the turn was invisible and the only
 * evidence of intent was how the reader moved the wheel. A card the reader can
 * see and has scrolled up to carries that intent itself, so the gesture no
 * longer has to prove anything and one notch past the end is enough.
 *
 * What CANNOT be dropped is the lock, and it has to be silence-based rather
 * than a cooldown. A fixed cooldown lets one continuous spin turn again every
 * time it expires, which is how a single flick used to eat three chapters: a
 * chapter shorter than the viewport shows its own card immediately, so the
 * rest of the spin would spend on it. Requiring the wheel to actually GO QUIET
 * means one turn per gesture, however long the gesture runs.
 *
 * The lock lifts lazily, on the first event after a quiet gap, so this needs
 * no timer and no animation frame of its own.

 * Wheel deltas do not arrive in one unit. `deltaMode` says which: 0 pixels,

 * threshold silently rejects every event on a device that reports lines — the
 * reader scrolls at the edge and nothing happens, in either direction.
 *
 * Chromium reports pixels, so this is invisible in a browser and only shows
 * up in the app. The engine this gate replaced normalised deltaMode and had a
 * test for it; dropping that was a regression, and this is it restored.
