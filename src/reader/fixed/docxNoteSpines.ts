/**
 * Note bars for the DOCX reader.
 *
 * The reflowable reader draws these from React (components/NoteSpines),
 * but the DOCX page is built imperatively — blocks are cloned into a
 * page card and `<mark>` spans are injected into them — so this is the
 * same idea in plain DOM. Geometry comes from the shared `noteSpineBox`
 * and colour from `hlMark`, because a note should not look different
 * depending on which format the book happens to be in.
 *
 * The bar goes in the page's own margin: a DOCX page here is 760px wide
 * with a 56px margin, so a bar 14px out from the block edge sits well
 * inside the paper rather than on top of the words.
