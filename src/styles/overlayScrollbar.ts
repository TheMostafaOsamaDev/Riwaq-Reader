// App-wide overlay scrollbar: a slim, translucent bar that floats over the
// content while a container is scrolling, then fades out.
//
// Why a DOM thumb rather than `::-webkit-scrollbar`
// ------------------------------------------------
// The pseudo-element route can't produce the bar we want, for three reasons
// that are all engine limitations rather than tuning problems:
//
//   1. Chromium and WebKit ignore `transition` on scrollbar pseudo-elements,
//      so a thumb that is transparent at rest *snaps* out instead of fading.
//   2. A native gutter is always flush to the container edge — there is no
//      way to inset the bar from it.
//   3. It renders differently per platform (Android WebView and WKWebView
//      paint their own overlay bars and ignore parts of the styling; headless
//      Chromium ignores it outright), so it can't be pinned down or tested.
//
// A DOM thumb fixes all three and looks identical everywhere.
//
// One delegated listener covers every scroll area in the app — no per-
// component wiring, and a scroll surface added later gets the behaviour for
// free. Thumbs are positioned imperatively, so scrolling never pushes a React
// render. Opt a container out with `data-no-overlay-scrollbar` (the fixed-page
// viewer and ScrollArea do, since they ship their own bar).
