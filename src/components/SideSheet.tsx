// Reusable side sheet: a dimmed scrim + an edge-anchored panel that slides in
// *over* the reader content, dismissed by scrim click or Esc.
//
// Shared by the reflowable DesktopReader and the FixedPageReader so both
// readers get identical open/close motion, Esc-to-close and RTL-correct
// direction of travel.
//
// Two modes. Tool panels OVERLAY: they float over the reader on a scrim and
// you dismiss them. Contents DOCKS (`dock`), joining the flex row as a real
// sibling so the chapter list stays on screen while you read. Docking was
// removed once before because only the reflowable reader did it, so the same
// click behaved differently on a PDF; both readers now derive `dock` from
// reader/chrome/dockContents.ts, which is what keeps them in step.
//
// Animation: the panel mounts OFF-SCREEN with no transition, then flips to its
// resting position on the next frame via a CSS transition. Driving the slide
// with a transition (rather than a keyframe applied at mount time) is the
// engine-agnostic way to guarantee the enter plays: WebKit/WKWebView can skip a
// keyframe that is present on a node the instant it is inserted, which made the
// enter "snap" while the exit (a class change on an already-painted node) stayed
// smooth. Forcing a paint of the off-screen state before the flip fixes that.
//
// `side` is LOGICAL: "left" = the reader's leading edge, "right" = trailing.
// The panel is anchored with logical inset properties so it rests on the correct
// edge under RTL automatically; the *physical* off-screen translate is picked to
// match wherever it actually lands (see `physicalSide`) so it slides off its own
// edge rather than sweeping across the reader under RTL.
//
// The sheet fills its positioning parent (`position: absolute; inset: 0`), so
// mount it inside the reader's *content* region (below the chrome) — that keeps
// the chrome bar and its toggle buttons above the scrim and fully clickable.
