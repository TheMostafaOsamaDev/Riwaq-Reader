/**
 * Dev-only. Lets the reader stamp "what I am looking at right now is wrong"
 * into the log, and confirms on screen that it landed.
 *
 * A blank reading pane cannot be detected from script — every measurement
 * reads correct while the screen shows nothing — so the one piece of
 * information no instrumentation can supply is the reader's own eyes. Pressing
 * ⌘⇧L writes a marked snapshot and flushes the file immediately, so the log
 * says exactly which moment to look at.
 *
 * The banner matters as much as the key: without visible confirmation, a press
 * that worked is indistinguishable from one the OS swallowed, which already
 * cost a round of this investigation.
