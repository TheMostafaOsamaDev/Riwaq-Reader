## What is Riwaq?

Riwaq (رواق) reads the books you already have — EPUBs, scanned PDFs, `.docx` drafts,
translated web novels — in whatever language they're written in. The interface comes in
English and Arabic, and it goes out of its way on the things long reading sessions depend
on: typography you can actually tune, layouts that hold still, and text that stays
readable for hours.

Right-to-left gets first-class treatment rather than an afterthought — mirrored interface,
diacritics, Naskh and Kufi faces — which is unusual enough to be worth saying out loud.

It is one app on every platform: a Tauri 2 shell around a React 19 front end, desktop and
phone from the same codebase. Everything is a file on your disk — no database, no cloud,
nothing to sign into.

---

## What makes it good

### 📚 A Store that reads the web for you

Browse Arabic web-novel sites from inside the app. Riwaq ships with three sources, renders
each site's own home page as native carousels, and searches them without opening a browser.
Pick a novel and you can **stream it chapter by chapter**, **add it to your library**, or
**download a range of chapters** for offline reading.

![Browsing a source in the Store](docs/screenshots/desktop/11-store-browse.png)

Every novel gets a real detail page — synopsis, genres, volumes, full chapter list — with
one-tap download per chapter or per volume.

![A novel detail page](docs/screenshots/desktop/12-store-novel.png)

### 🌙 Focus mode

One click and everything but the page disappears. No toolbar, no progress bar, no chrome.
Move the pointer to the top or bottom edge and the controls come back.

![Focus mode](docs/screenshots/desktop/03-focus-mode.png)

### ✍️ Typography you can actually tune

**17 reading faces** in four groups — Naskh book faces, modern sans, Kufi, and display.
One picker drives both scripts: every row previews Arabic and Latin side by side, and a
family that only carries one of them shows the fallback rather than hiding it. You pick by
eye, not by name.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/desktop/05-fonts.png" alt="Font picker showing each family in its own face"/></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/desktop/04-typography.png" alt="Typography controls"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

Then tune it: size, line height, letter spacing, paragraph spacing, content width,
alignment, hyphenation. Read as **two pages**, a **single page**, or a **continuous scroll**.

### 🎨 Four themes, light to OLED

Light, Sepia, Dark, and a true-black OLED — or follow your system.

<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/desktop/20-dark-library.png" alt="Library in dark theme"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

### 🖍️ Highlights you can actually find again

Select any passage, pick one of four colours, and attach a note about why it mattered.
The sidebar collects every highlight in the book with its chapter, so you can walk back
through them later.

<tr>

<td width="50%"><img src="docs/screenshots/desktop/06-highlights.png" alt="Highlights and notes sidebar"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

### 🌐 Two interface languages, mirrored properly

English and العربية, and the translation goes all the way down — not just the book text.
Switch to Arabic and the sidebar moves to the right, icons flip, and every label follows.

![The interface in Arabic, fully right-to-left](docs/screenshots/desktop/18-arabic-rtl.png)

### 🗂️ A library that stays tidy

Reading progress on every cover, format badges for PDF and Word, source badges for novels,
status filters (Reading / Finished / Wishlist), and your own shelves for anything else.

`⌘K` opens a command palette over the whole app — search books and authors as you type, or
jump straight to any view.

![Searching the library from the command palette](docs/screenshots/desktop/16-search.png)

### ⬇️ Downloads that survive a restart

A real queue: per-chapter and per-volume downloads, concurrency limits, Wi-Fi-only mode,
retry for interrupted jobs, and system notifications while it works. Or bake a whole novel
into a standalone EPUB — one file, or one per volume — that lands in your library next to
everything else.

![Download queue](docs/screenshots/desktop/13-downloads.png)

### 📄 PDF and Word, not just EPUB

PDFs render through pdf.js with their own page controls — fit to width or page, scroll or
paged flow, zoom, and a page tint that dims or inverts a harsh scan. Word documents are
converted on import, with a step to pick the cover and review images first.

## Everything else

| | |
|---|---|
| **Formats** | EPUB 2 / 3, PDF, `.docx` |
| **Getting books in** | File picker, folder of EPUBs, drag and drop, or **Open with** from your file manager and Android's share sheet. Re-importing the same file reuses the existing book instead of duplicating it. |
| **Reader** | Two-page / single-page / scrolling layouts, tap-to-turn with adjustable zones, chapter progress bar, page-turn animation, keep-screen-awake |
| **Navigation** | Contents with per-volume grouping, chapter search, a *Now* marker and jump-to-current; a progress scrubber across the whole book |
| **Library** | Continue-reading hero, shelves, status filters, right-click menu, editable title / author / description / cover |
| **Settings** | A full settings page with its own search — appearance, reading, behaviour, downloads, data. Export, import, or reset every preference. |
| **Platforms** | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android — one codebase, layout-aware shells (bottom nav on phones, sidebar on desktop) |
| **Privacy** | No account, no sync, no telemetry. State is plain JSON on your disk. The only network traffic is the Store, when you use it. |

## Download

Builds are attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/TheMostafaOsamaDev/Riwaq-ebook-reader/releases).
Pick the file for your platform:

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| **Windows** (most PCs) | `Riwaq_<ver>_x64-setup.exe` — or `Riwaq_<ver>_x64_en-US.msi` |
| **Windows on ARM** | `Riwaq_<ver>_arm64-setup.exe` |
| **macOS** (Intel **and** Apple Silicon) | `Riwaq_<ver>_universal.dmg` |
| **Linux** — Debian / Ubuntu | `Riwaq_<ver>_amd64.deb` · `_arm64.deb` |
| **Linux** — Fedora / RHEL | `Riwaq-<ver>-1.x86_64.rpm` · `.aarch64.rpm` |
| **Linux** — portable | `Riwaq_<ver>_amd64.AppImage` · `_aarch64.AppImage` |
| **Android** | `app-universal-release.apk` |

### First launch

The builds aren't code-signed yet, so desktop systems warn once. These steps don't recur.

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b></summary>

SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"* → **More info** → **Run anyway**.
Or before launching: right-click the installer → **Properties** → tick **Unblock** → OK.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b></summary>

Gatekeeper blocks unsigned, un-notarized apps. Open the `.dmg`, drag **Riwaq** to
Applications, then **right-click the app → Open → Open**. If it still refuses, clear the
quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Riwaq.app
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Linux</b></summary>

The `.deb` / `.rpm` install and run as-is. For the AppImage, mark it executable first:

```bash
chmod +x Riwaq_*.AppImage && ./Riwaq_*.AppImage
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Android</b></summary>

Sideload the APK — your browser or file manager will ask you to allow *"install from
unknown sources"*. Play Store distribution isn't planned; F-Droid is a possible future
channel.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Verifying your download</b></summary>

Every release ships a `SHA256SUMS` manifest. Put it next to your download and check:

- Linux: `sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS`
- macOS: `shasum -a 256 <file>`, then compare with the matching line in `SHA256SUMS`
</details>

## Sources

| Source | Site | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **فضاء الروايات** | [cenele.com](https://cenele.com) | Arabic translations of Asian web novels. Some pages sit behind bot protection; the first request to a chapter may need a session refresh. |
| **ملوك الروايات** | [kolnovel.com](https://kolnovel.com) | Arabic translations of Korean / Chinese / Japanese web novels. |
| **ملوك الروايات** | [kolnovel.com](https://kolnovel.com) | The same site again, through Riwaq's alternate **Pro** reader. |

Riwaq hosts and redistributes nothing. The Store reads publicly available pages so you can
read them offline. Support the translators and official releases where they exist.

---

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev          # desktop, with Vite HMR
pnpm android:dev        # Android, on a device or emulator
pnpm test               # unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm tauri build        # production bundles for the current OS
```

Vite serves on port **1420** (HMR on 1421) and a single dev server backs both the desktop
window and Android at once. For Android, the device must reach the host over your LAN — or
use `adb reverse tcp:1420 tcp:1420` on an emulator.

More detail lives in [`docs/`](docs/): [`setup.md`](docs/setup.md) for toolchains and
bundling, [`architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for module boundaries and data flow,
[`ANDROID.md`](docs/ANDROID.md) for the Android specifics, and
[`store-feature/`](docs/store-feature/README.md) for how source extensions work.

### Stack

- **[Tauri 2](https://tauri.app)** — desktop + mobile shell (Rust)
- **[React 19](https://react.dev)** + **TypeScript** + **[Vite](https://vite.dev)**
- **[pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)** for PDFs, **[JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/)** for EPUB, **[Mammoth](https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js)** for `.docx`
- State persists as JSON through Tauri's filesystem plugin — no SQLite, no IndexedDB, no server

## Fonts

Every face ships inside the app and is served locally — Riwaq makes no font requests at
runtime.

Bundled under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL), each with its
license text alongside it in [`public/fonts/`](public/fonts):

**Readex Pro** (interface) · **Noto Naskh Arabic** · **Scheherazade New** ·
**Markazi Text** · **Mirza** · **Lateef** · **Cairo** · **Tajawal** · **Almarai** ·
**IBM Plex Sans Arabic** · **Alexandria** · **Vazirmatn** · **El Messiri** ·
**Noto Kufi Arabic** · **Changa** · **Lalezar**

**Thmanyah Serif Display** is also bundled but ships without a license file — its terms
still need to be confirmed before any distribution that relies on it.
